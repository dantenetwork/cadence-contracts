# Protocol stack for cadence
Protocol stack implemented with cadence that provide some of the basic functions of the dante protocol stack to make resources on Flow be Omnichain.

## Current Developing
Development in branch `Crypto-dev`

## Version : 0.0.1
Dante protocol stack are mainly as below: 
* [SentMessageContract](./contracts/SentMessageContract.cdc)
* [ReceivedMessageContract](./contracts/ReceivedMessageContract.cdc)
* [CrossChain](./contracts/CrossChain.cdc)
* [IdentityVerification](./contracts/IdentityVerification.cdc)

This repository contains examples of contracts that are useful when deploying, managing, and/or using an DANTE network. They are provided for reference purposes:
* [Examples](./examples/)
   * [An cross chain NFT Locker](./examples/Locker.cdc)

## Coming Soon...
Currently, you can try Dante Protocol on Flow by reading example [code sources](./examples/Locker.cdc).

We will add tutorials of how to use Dante Protocol to make your dApps on Flow be multi-ecosystems accessed. Recently we are short of staff so this part will come later. We welcome more interested partners to join.  


## Important note
* The private keys included in flow.json & default.json are used for test net debugging only. 

* **Note that if you want to try a demo on Testnet, we recommand you go [here](https://github.com/xiyu1984/one-nft-one-funny/blob/main/Multi-Ecosystems.md) to try it as we have prepared all things.**
