# Challenge

## Test workflow

- ***Note that suppose we have put the repos `/cadence-contracts`, `/flow-sdk`, and `/flow-off-chain` in the same directory.***  
- ***Note that all the underlying mechanisms related to cross-chain recource/smart contract invocations are guaranteed by Dante Protocol, and you can find how to use the SDK to interact with Dante [here](https://github.com/dantenetwork/flow-sdk/blob/SQoS/exampleApp/computation/contracts/Cocomputation.cdc).***
